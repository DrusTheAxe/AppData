APPDATA.EXE README
==================

OVERVIEW
--------
APPDATA.EXE is a Windows command line application to access and manipulate [ApplicationData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR241587), new in Windows 8. This is particularly useful if you develop applications, manage applications, or are just plain curious about what an application is storing on your behalf.

Run with no parameters for help.

This was inspired by practical needs over several long nights and weekends working on some Windows store apps. The 'spiritual' inspiration for the technical approach is [REG.EXE](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/reg.mspx?mfr=true). Consider APPDATA.EXE is to ApplicationData as REG.EXE is to the Registry.


INSTALLATION
------------
APPDATA.EXE requires ApplicationData APIs, new in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

It's implemented in [.NET Framework 4.5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w0x726c2.aspx).

The executable is a self-contained application. All you need is APPDATA.EXE. Build and go :-) Precompiled binaries are available at the [APPDATA.EXE home](http://appdata.kapustein.com)
