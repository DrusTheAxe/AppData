APPDATA.EXE README
==================

OVERVIEW
--------
APPDATA.EXE is a Windows command line application to access and manipulate
[ApplicationData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR241587), introduced in Windows 8.
This is particularly useful if you develop applications, manage applications, or are just plain
curious about what an application is storing on your behalf.

Run with no parameters for help.

This was inspired by practical needs over several long nights and weekends working on some package
apps. The 'spiritual' inspiration for the technical approach is
[REG.EXE](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/reg.mspx?mfr=true).
Think of APPDATA.EXE is to ApplicationData as REG.EXE is to the Registry.


INSTALLATION
------------
APPDATA.EXE requires ApplicationData APIs, introduced for packaged apps in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
