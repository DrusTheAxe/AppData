<h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>APPDATA.EXE is a Windows command line application to access and manipulate
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR241587">ApplicationData</a>, introduced in Windows 8.
This is particularly useful if you develop applications, manage applications, or are just plain
curious about what an application is storing on your behalf.</p>
<p>Run with no parameters for help.</p>
<p>This was inspired by practical needs over several long nights and weekends working on some package
apps. The &#39;spiritual&#39; inspiration for the technical approach is
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/reg.mspx?mfr=true">REG.EXE</a>.
Think of APPDATA.EXE is to ApplicationData as REG.EXE is to the Registry.</p>
<h2 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h2>
